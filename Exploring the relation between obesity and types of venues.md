**Exploring the relation between obesity and types of venues by in selected counties in US**

**Introduction:**
It is now common knowledge that obesity is a result of a few factors, like physical activity and nutrition. Government health agencies, like the Center for Disease Control (CDC) maintain a repository of data and maps showing the prevalence of obesity in different regions of US. They also keep data on risk factors for obesity, such as nutrition and physical activity and related to that, the proximity to places of physical activity. Other large private healthcare organizations also have published data on obesity and availability of physical activity, by county, and this data is available to the public for download. However, one exploration that seems to be missing, is the type of venues that are present, in areas of high incidence of obesity (and more limited availability of physical activity) versus areas where obesity is low and places where physical activity is easily available. In my project, I plan to explore the differences at regional level between the mix of venues, in areas of high versus low obesity.  The purpose for this investigation of whether there are significant differences in the venue mix,  is to understand whether the type of data that Foursquare API provides can be used in further research.

**Data:**
The obesity and obesity risk factors data that I will use comes from CDC and the Robert Wood Johnson foundation which are available to the public for download.  For the types of venues I will be using the Foursquare data which is available through the API. I will also be using data for  creating maps, data for matching counties (which is how healthcare organizations publish their data) with zip codes (which is how I will obtain data from the Foursquare API). Additionally, in order to allow avoiding looking at outliers and comparing very large with very small states, I will use data that shows the population in each state. Because of the sheer number of venues in each state, and the API limits for FourSquare, I am not going to be able to analyze full state data, but will focus instead on the comparing the the top and bottom few counties from few states that have high versus low prevalence of obesity.
